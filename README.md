## About Me 📝

### What Do I Do? 🔧

- I'm a scripter who loves helping people bring their **dream games to life**  
- I'm fully **transparent** — whether it's about pricing or making sure I deliver **exactly** what you want and need  
- I offer **lower prices** than most scripters, giving you **the best value for your money**  

### Fun Fact 💡

- If you haven't already noticed, I'm obsessed with "porgs"!  
- They're weird little creatures from *Star Wars*, based on puffins — and yes, that addiction made it into all my usernames  
- And if you've ever thought my name was weird: it's because "**pog**" is hiding in "**porg**"!

## Scripting Experience & Skills 💼

### Experience ⏳

- I have just over a year of experience  
- That said, I work at a **higher level than many scripters** with the same — or even more — time in Roblox development  
- I’ve spent almost every day of that year **challenging myself** with new concepts and applying them practically  
- I’m still actively learning and refining my craft to stay on top of **modern techniques** and build the **best modern solutions**  

These 4 points show my **devotion to scripting**!

### My Skills 🛠️

- I write **clean, easy-to-read code**  
- My code is extremely **modular**, meaning your game is easy to expand later  
- I've worked in all kinds of genres — from **engaging UI** and **simple combat** to **high-precision raycasts** and **complex physics systems**

## Hiring Me 🚀

### How I Work

- I **prefer short-term commissions** (under 7 days), but don’t hesitate to ask about **long-term partnerships**!  
- I’ll provide a **rough timeframe** up front, but it’s not guaranteed  
- I offer **free bug fixes** — as long as my script wasn't altered and you clearly didn’t want the behavior in question  

### Pricing 💸

- I price based on estimated time:
  - Revenue-sharing (percentages) is evaluated case-by-case: current revenue, CCU, past projects, etc.  
- 💵 $15/hour (PayPal)  
  - Or equivalent Robux at **DevEx value after tax**, +20% fee if the total is **under 30k Robux after tax** (since I might have to wait months to cash it out)  
- You pay after I finish:
  - I show proof it’s functional → you pay → I deliver the Roblox game file
