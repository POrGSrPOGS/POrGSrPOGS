## About Me 📝

### What do I do? 🔧

- I'm a scripter who loves helping people make their **dream games possible**
- I am completely **transparent**, whether that's pricing, or making sure I'm making **exactly** what you want and need
- I also work for **lower prices** than other scripters, giving you **the best value for your money**

### Fun fact 💡

- If you haven't already noticed something about me, it's that I love "porgs"!
- They're a strange creature from Star Wars based off of a puffin and my addiction has led to them being a part of all my usernames
- And if you ever thought my username was weird, it represents that the word "pog" is in porg!

## Scripting Experience & Skills 💼

### Experience ⏳

- I have just over a year experience
- However, I work at a **higher level than other scripters** with as much or even **more** time in roblox than me
- Unlike others, I spent almost every day of the year **challenging myself** with new concepts and overall being more practical
- I'm still actively learning! I continue learning the best **modern techniques** to provide you with the best **modern solutions**

I hope these 4 points demonstrate **my devotion** towards scripting!

### My Skills 📚

- I create **clean, easy to read code**
- I'm also extremely modular meaning you can **expand your games with minimal effort**
- I have worked in all kinds of generes, from **engaging ui and simple combat** to **extreme accuracy** with raycasts and **complex physics systems**

## Hiring me 🚀

### How I work

- I **prefer** short commissions (< 7 days to finish). HOWEVER, **do not hesitate** to ask me for a long term parternship!
- I will give you a **rought** timeframe but it is not guaranteed
- I provide all my customers with bug fixes in my scripts if it has **NOT been changed** and it was made clear you didn't want that functionality

### Pricing 💸

- Payment is based on how many hours I think it will take to finish
  - Percentages in games will be evaluated by your game's current revenue, CCU, past works and anything else
- 15$/Equivalent in rbx (SEE BELOW) an Hour (Paypal)
  - This means devex value of the rbx **AFTER TAX** + 20% if it's under 30k rbx after tax (as I can have to wait MONTHS before exchanging) 
- I work by payment on completion
  - (I show proof it's finished + functional -> you pay -> I send over the roblox game file)
